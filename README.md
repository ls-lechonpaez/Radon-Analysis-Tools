### Overview and Research Focus

The primary goal of this research was to understand and quantify the concentration of radon gas ($Rn^{222}$) in various environmental matrices. Accurate measurement and comprehensive analysis are essential for radiological protection and environmental studies.

Key areas of focus included:
* **Measurement and analysis** of experimental data from radon gas and other radioactive materials.
* **Expertise in nuclear techniques** and the use of specialized equipment for measuring $Rn^{222}$ gas activity.
* Conducting research on **radon concentration** in different matrices, including water, air, and construction materials.

### Methodology and Instruments

This project involved the collection and analysis of data using various nuclear and radiometric techniques.

| Instrument / Technique | Application and Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **RAD7 Electronic Radon Detector** | Used for continuous and discrete measurements of radon activity in air and water. |
| **Electret Ion Chambers (E-PERM)** | Employed for passive, integrated measurements of radon concentration, especially in long-term indoor monitoring. |
| **Pylon/Alpha Spectrometry System** | Used for laboratory measurements, calibration, and precise determination of alpha activity in samples. |
| **Closed Chamber Technique** | Used for measuring the radon exhalation rate from materials, such as Italian tuff. |
